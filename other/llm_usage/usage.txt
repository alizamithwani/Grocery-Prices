Discussion: Correlation vs. Causation

Understanding the distinction between correlation and causation is fundamental to interpreting data accurately and making informed decisions. These two concepts, while often appearing together in statistical analysis, signify different types of relationships between variables and should not be used interchangeably.

1. Correlation: Definition and Implications
Correlation refers to a statistical relationship or association between two variables. When two variables are correlated, changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. Correlations can be positive (where both variables increase or decrease together) or negative (where one variable increases as the other decreases). However, correlation does not imply that one variable influences or causes the other; it merely suggests a relationship between them.

An example of correlation is the relationship between ice cream sales and temperature. During warmer months, ice cream sales and temperature rise together, indicating a positive correlation. However, this correlation does not mean that increasing ice cream sales cause the temperature to rise, or vice versa.

2. Causation: Definition and Implications
Causation, or causality, indicates a cause-and-effect relationship, where one variable directly influences the other. For causation to be established, rigorous testing must confirm that changes in one variable result in changes in the other, independent of other factors. Establishing causation often requires controlled experiments or longitudinal studies that can account for potential confounding variables.

A clear example of causation is the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Extensive research, including controlled studies, has shown that smoking directly increases the risk of developing lung cancer, establishing a causal relationship. In this case, the mechanism (the chemicals in cigarettes causing cell damage) is well-understood, reinforcing the cause-and-effect link.

3. Why Confusion Arises
Confusion between correlation and causation often arises due to the presence of confounding variables or coincidental relationships. For instance, a study might find a correlation between the number of hours spent on social media and levels of anxiety. While it’s tempting to conclude that social media causes anxiety, it’s possible that a third variable, such as poor sleep, influences both social media use and anxiety levels.

Misinterpretations can also stem from the limitations of observational studies, which can reveal correlations but rarely establish causation due to lack of control over extraneous variables. Misleading conclusions can result if researchers or audiences assume that correlation inherently means causation.

4. Establishing Causation: Methods and Challenges
To determine causation, researchers often rely on experiments, particularly randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which can isolate the effect of a single variable by randomly assigning subjects to different conditions. When RCTs are impractical or unethical, researchers may use longitudinal studies, which observe changes over time, or statistical methods like instrumental variables or regression discontinuity to help infer causality.

Despite these methods, proving causation remains challenging, especially in social sciences and economics, where variables are complex and interdependent. For example, assessing the causal impact of education on income is difficult because education level may correlate with other factors, such as family background and access to resources, that also affect income.

5. Why the Distinction Matters
Failing to distinguish between correlation and causation can lead to misguided policies, wasted resources, or even harm. For example, if policymakers mistakenly conclude that a correlation between neighborhood crime rates and certain socioeconomic factors implies causation, they may implement ineffective or unjust measures. Accurate interpretation is essential for sound decision-making in fields like public health, economics, and policy.

In conclusion, while correlation can provide valuable insights into relationships between variables, it is not evidence of causation. Careful analysis, control of confounding variables, and appropriate methodology are essential for establishing causality. Emphasizing this distinction improves our ability to interpret data responsibly and make more effective decisions.

Understanding the difference between correlation and causation is crucial for accurate data interpretation. Correlation means two variables are related or tend to move together—like ice cream sales and temperature increasing in summer. However, correlation does not mean that one variable causes the other. Causation, on the other hand, implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship, where changes in one variable produce changes in another. Establishing causation usually requires controlled experiments or longitudinal studies to rule out other influencing factors.

Mistaking correlation for causation can lead to faulty conclusions. For example, if a study finds a correlation between social media use and anxiety, it’s tempting to assume social media causes anxiety, though other factors, like sleep patterns, may be involved. Misinterpreting these relationships can lead to misguided policies or decisions. By carefully distinguishing between these concepts, researchers can make more informed and effective conclusions, ensuring policies and strategies are based on solid evidence.

Understanding the distinction between correlation and causation is essential for accurate analysis and responsible decision-making. Correlation indicates an association between two variables that tend to move together, but it does not imply that one causes the other. Causation, however, is a cause-and-effect relationship where changes in one variable directly lead to changes in another. Establishing causation often requires rigorous methods, such as controlled experiments, to rule out other influencing factors and confirm the direct link between variables.

Misinterpreting correlation as causation can lead to incorrect conclusions and ineffective policies or actions. By recognizing that correlation does not automatically mean causation, researchers and analysts can avoid drawing unwarranted inferences and instead base conclusions on solid, evidence-backed relationships. Distinguishing between these concepts ensures more accurate data interpretation and more effective decisions across various fields.

Notes About the Data
Which grocery vendors' prices are included?
Voila, T&T, Loblaws, No Frills, Metro, Galleria, Walmart Canada, Save-On-Foods.

How was the data gathered?
This information is from a screen-scrape of website UI - that's why it is missing information that you might get from the internal APIs that power grocers' websites.

Prices are for the "in store pickup" option, as set for a neighbourhood in Toronto.

Is there data for every day and every vendor?
No. Between Feb. 28 and July 10/11, I was gathering prices for a "small basket" of products. After that, we have prices for a much larger variety of products. Also, there may be missing data for certain days for certain vendors - days on which those specific extracts failed.

What are the columns in the data?

Column	Description
nowtime	Timestamp indicating when the data was gathered
vendor	One of the 7 grocery vendors
product_id	An internal ID for a product - it represents 1 unique product at 1 vendor. It will allow you to track prices on the same product over time.

Notes: these IDs may change as the data is refreshed. Don't rely on them being consistent across different versions of the dataset - they'll be internally consistent for your "current download" only. Also, the IDs are not consistent across vendors. Only within a single vendor.
product_name	Product name. May include Brand, may include Units in it.
brand	Brand name. May be blank for some vendors.
units	Units (grams, kg, number of items in package). May be blank for some vendors/products.
current_price	Price at time of extract
old_price	An "old" struck-out price. This indicates that there was a Sale on. This is how you can differentiate a price-drop advertised as a Sale vs. a "quiet" decrease without a Sale.
price_per_unit	Price per unit, as shown on the vendor website. May not be consistent with real calculation of "current_price" divided by "units". Double check it.
other	Other details that appeared on the listing. Values may be "Out of stock", "SALE", "Best seller", "$5.00 MIN 2"
SQLite file notes

product table: this table contains vendor, product_name, units and brand
raw table: contains the time series price data - nowtime, current_price, old_price, price_per_unit
The two tables are joined using product.id and raw.product_id
To speed things up, there is an index on raw.product_id
Simple example of how you'd grab all product data for the Becel brand. Note that for certain vendors, "Becel" would only be present in product_name, for others - only in the brand:

SELECT nowtime, vendor, product_id, product_name, brand, current_price, old_price, units, price_per_unit, other 
	FROM raw 
	INNER JOIN product 
	ON raw.product_id = product.id 
	WHERE product.product_name LIKE '%becel%' OR product.brand LIKE '%becel%';
Here's a more complex example of how you'd grab prices for all Miss Vickie's Original Recipe chips:

SELECT nowtime, vendor, product_id, product_name, brand, current_price, old_price, units, price_per_unit, other 
	FROM raw 
	INNER JOIN product 
	ON raw.product_id = product.id 
	WHERE
		(product.product_name LIKE '%original%' AND product.brand LIKE '%miss vick%') OR
		(product.product_name LIKE '%miss vick%original%');
Why does the query say "miss vick"?
It's because some grocers represent it as "Miss Vickies", "Miss Vickie's" and some as "Miss Vickies" with a weird UTF-8 quote that's not even on your keyboard. "miss vick" matches all of them. Here are the various products from the product table that the above statement will include:


Note how there are 3 distinct products here at different weights: 59g, 200g and 275g. To compare across vendors, you can refine your SQL query further or export to CSV for filtering in Excel.

I exported the results of the query above to Excel, kept only the 200g prices, created a PivotChart and got this workable visualization. You can see that Walmart has the lowest prices for Miss Vickies' Original Kettle Chips & the Asian-focused grocers have the highest.

Write 2 paragraphs for each sub-section under data section of my paper. Sub-sections are "Overview" "Measurement" "Outcome Variables" and the research question I'm answering using this data is "Do certain bundles of products tend to get marked-down more (frequency or magnitude) during sales for each vendor?"

Overview

This dataset includes grocery price information gathered from various Toronto vendors: Voila, T&T, Loblaws, No Frills, Metro, Galleria, Walmart Canada, and Save-On-Foods. Prices were collected for products under the "in store pickup" option in a Toronto neighborhood. The data was screen-scraped directly from website user interfaces, so some information that may be accessible via internal APIs is missing. Initially, data collection focused on a "small basket" of products, from February 28 through early July, after which it expanded to cover a larger variety of items. This structured dataset allows us to track price changes over time across multiple vendors, offering a foundation for comparative analysis of pricing behaviors and promotions.

However, the dataset does have some limitations due to its collection method. Notably, data for certain vendors or specific days may be absent if extraction processes failed, leading to potential gaps in the dataset. Additionally, product identification relies on vendor-specific internal IDs that may change with data refreshes, limiting the continuity of analysis over multiple data versions. These IDs remain consistent within a single vendor for any given download, though they are not universal across vendors. Understanding these limitations is important for accurate interpretation, especially when comparing price behaviors across different vendors.

Measurement

The data is structured with columns capturing details such as timestamps, vendor information, product ID, product name, brand, units, and pricing details. Timestamps mark when prices were gathered, enabling time-series analysis of price trends. Product names often include brands or units, while separate columns provide brand names and units explicitly, though these may be blank for some vendors. Each record includes a "current price" at the time of extraction, an "old price" indicating a struck-out former price to signal sales, and a price per unit, though this unit price may occasionally differ from an actual division of price by units.

Each product entry is linked to a unique ID within the vendor's system, allowing consistent price tracking over time. However, these IDs are not stable across dataset versions, meaning that new downloads may introduce different IDs, complicating long-term tracking. In cases where brands are represented differently across vendors (e.g., "Miss Vickies" with variations in apostrophe placement), SQL queries are used to account for these inconsistencies, ensuring comprehensive analysis across vendor representations.

Outcome Variables

The primary outcome variables in this study are the frequency and magnitude of markdowns across products for each vendor. The "current price" and "old price" columns capture direct price changes, providing insights into markdown events. The presence of an "old price" generally signifies a sale, allowing for differentiation between explicit sales events and subtler price fluctuations. By observing trends in these variables, it’s possible to quantify markdown frequency (how often a product is marked down) and magnitude (the amount by which prices are reduced) across different vendors.

This setup also allows for exploring whether specific product bundles are subject to more frequent or substantial markdowns. By examining various combinations of products and vendors, patterns in promotional pricing can be identified, contributing to a broader understanding of sales strategies across the grocery market. This analysis is particularly valuable for identifying whether vendors follow similar or different markdown practices, highlighting competitive pricing behaviors within Toronto’s grocery industry.

Research Question

This study investigates whether specific bundles of products experience more frequent or greater markdowns during sales, comparing these trends across vendors. This analysis addresses the question: "Do certain bundles of products tend to get marked-down more (frequency or magnitude) during sales for each vendor?" Answering this involves tracking the occurrence and size of markdowns across a variety of products and vendors, enabling comparisons in promotional patterns within the Toronto grocery market.

To answer this question, the dataset allows for identifying which types of products are most frequently marked down and for observing any discernible differences in markdown practices among vendors. By focusing on the frequency and magnitude of markdowns, this research can reveal patterns in vendor sales strategies, providing insights into whether certain bundles are prioritized for price reductions. Understanding these trends helps characterize competitive behavior and pricing strategies in Toronto’s diverse grocery market.
